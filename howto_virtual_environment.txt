create a virtual environment to automatically ensure all the dependencies of the module APNano are installed

use conda for managing environments. It would be wise to install Miniconda since this is both a decent python distrubution and also comes with conda.

https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/

run the command:

conda env create -f "insert path to .yml file here"

e.g. on my machine, currently the path to the .yml file is: 

D:\PhD_data\OneDrive - Imperial College London\1. PhD\python_dev\nanoindenter_python\environment.yml

yours will be different!

(if conda can't be found, try running the command from the dedicated anaconda prompt installed with miniconda)

I will be sure to update the .yml file if the dependencies change.

in case of updates to the .yml file, run:

conda env update -f "insert path to .yml file here"

select the environment within your IDE or to run python from the command line, activate the environment using:

conda activate NameOfEnvironment 

(in this case the environment is called APNano, this is stored in the .yml file.)
